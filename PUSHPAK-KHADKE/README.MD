# Title
I2C-Based DS1307 RTC Device Driver with IoT Cloud Integration

# Description
Developed a Linux device driver for the DS1307 Real-Time Clock (RTC) using the I2C protocol on BeagleBone Black. Implemented battery backup to maintain accurate time during power loss and integrated the system with the ThingSpeak IoT cloud using the MQTT protocol for real-time remote monitoring of time data.
